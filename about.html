      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>I am an aspiring software engineer currently enrolled as an 
        undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science
        with a concentration in machine learning. I was born in Pittsburgh, PA and moved to Gainesville, FL
        in 2008 when I was four years old. I lived in Gainesville until I graduated from Buchholz High School, then 
        went back to Pittsburgh for college. It's funny how some parts of the past always seem to stick with you.
        I am currently interested in activities such as developing web applications, building deep learning models, and 
        exploring the theory behind everything this world has to offer. My end goal professionally is to be in a flexible software
        role continuously working on thought-provoking projects that have potential to benefit the lives of future generations.
      </p>
